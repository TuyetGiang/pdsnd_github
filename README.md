# Bikeshare Analysis Project

This project analyzes bikeshare data from different cities in the US.

## Project Overview

The project prompts the user to specify a city, month, and day to analyze the bikeshare data. It then loads the data, applies filters as per the user's inputs, and displays various statistics.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you'll need Python 3 and the Pandas library installed on your computer.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have the required CSV files for the cities you want to analyze (chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv).
3. Run the 'bikeshare.py' script.

## Project Structure

- `bikeshare.py`: The main Python script to run the bikeshare analysis.
- `chicago.csv`, `new_york_city.csv`, `washington.csv`: CSV files containing bikeshare data for the respective cities.

## Usage

1. When you run the script, it will prompt you to enter the city, month, and day of the week to analyze.
2. After entering the inputs, the script will display statistics on the most frequent times of travel, the most popular stations and trips, trip durations, and user statistics.
3. Additionally, the script will prompt you if you want to see 5 lines of raw data. You can type 'yes' to view the data or 'no' to skip.
